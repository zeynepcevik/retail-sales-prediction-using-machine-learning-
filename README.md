## Retail Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores a real-world retail sales dataset that includes diverse features such as store types, location classifications, regional distributions, holiday indicators, applied discounts, and sales/order quantities. The primary objective is to gain actionable insights into customer behavior, evaluate the effect of promotions on sales, and compare performance across different types of stores.

Due to its mix of temporal, categorical, and numerical variables, the dataset enables a rich set of exploratory analyses and allows the application of multiple data preprocessing and machine learning techniques. It serves as a valuable resource for both descriptive analytics and predictive modeling.

### Applied Machine Learning Techniques

We aim to develop predictive models that forecast store performance and order volume using the following algorithms:

* **Decision Tree**: Helps interpret how factors like store type, location, discounts, and holidays influence sales.
* **Random Forest**: An ensemble approach that reduces overfitting and improves accuracy. It also provides insights into feature importance.
* **Logistic Regression**: Applied when continuous variables such as sales or orders are converted into categorical labels (e.g., high, medium, low).

### Dataset Summary

The dataset includes the following key columns:

* `Store_ID`, `Store_Type`, `Location_Type`, `Region_Code`
* `Holiday`, `Discount`, `#Order`, `Sales`

This dataset enables the identification of factors that influence sales and order volumes. For example, we investigate whether holidays increase demand, whether discounts lead to more purchases, and how regional and store-type variations contribute to overall performance. These insights can guide marketing strategies and improve forecasting accuracy in the retail domain.
